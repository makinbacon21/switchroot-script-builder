# Switchroot Android Q Scripted Builder (Deprecated)

Use https://github.com/PabloZaiden/switchroot-android-build
I've been updating Pablo's Dockerized builder regularly, but this one is quite dead. If you don't want to use Docker, either use his build minus Docker or build manually using my new(ish) `snack` script, built to automate much of the manual local build process (https://github.com/makinbacon21/snack).


One script to rule them all

Automates the steps of the Q-Tips Guide (https://gitlab.com/ZachyCatGames/q-tips-guide)

DISCLAIMER: Switchroot Android Q is still in development and may harm your device--a public image release will come soon, but this script builds the early-stage product for testing purposes. The current public release (Switchroot Android Oreo) is available using this guide: https://forum.xda-developers.com/t/rom-unofficial-8-1-switchroot-lineageos-15-1.3951389/

# Features
Supports Android (`icosa`) (`foster_tab`) and Android TV (`foster`)

Clean build and updates

OC coreboot (memory overclock)

OC patch (CPU)

Joycon patch (snapshot button takes screenshots)

GApps and Hekate download

Option to preroot with magisk

# Requirements
Ubuntu 20.04+ (WSL2 works now on NTFS or ext4 filesystems, but NTFS is kinda slow and not recommended)

16GB RAM (or smaller amounts with a sizeable swapfile)

~300 GBs of available storage (sources + ccache)

Decent CPU (better CPU --> faster build)

Unpatched Erista-codenamed Nintendo Switch (https://ismyswitchpatched.com/) with RCM jig to trigger exploit

# Building
Syntax: `./Q_Builder.sh [-v | --verbose] [-n | --nosync] [-c | --clean]`

- `-v | --verbose`: Enables verbose mode (`set -x`) for debugging
- `-n | --nosync`: Runs build without `git reset` or `repo sync` (keeps source tree from last build intact)
- `-c | --clean`: Forces clean build (removes source tree and builds from scratch)
- `-u | --update`: Sets up the build for a dirty flash by preventing the download of twrp.img, and all files in switchroot/android folder
- `-e | --noccache`: Disables CCache for building (NOT RECOMMENDED--MOSTLY FOR TESTING PURPOSES)
- `-h | --help`: Long-winded help message

First `chmod +x Q_Builder.sh` to make it executable, thne run the script with `./Q_Builder.sh` and any arguments, and answer any prompts you get. Once stuff starts happening, there shouldn't be any more prompts unless you screwed something up
